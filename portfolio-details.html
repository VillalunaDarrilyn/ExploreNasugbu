          <h2>Must-See Attractions</h2>
          <p>
			<h3> Fortune Island </h3>
				Regarded as the Greece in the Philippines, Fortune Island was once an exclusive island owned by former Governor Jose Antonio Leviste. He envisioned the island to be an idyllic vacation spot designed for the upper echelon and drafted a luxurious beach resort the resembles the Acropolis of Athens in Greece. However, it can be quite costly and difficult to maintain a luxury resort without a steady source of freshwater which led to the inevitable cessation of operations in 2006. Back in the day, it was a best-kept secret among divers as the island is surrounded by shipwreck diving sites including the ill-fated Mauritius, a Dutch warship that sank on December 14, 1600.
			<h3> Hamilo Coast </h3>
				Known as the Amazon Rainforest of the seas, Hamilo Coast boasts of its 25 kilometers (15.53 miles) coastline. What makes Hamilo Coast such a compelling visit is that it showcases the best of both land and sea. It presents three mountain peaks on the east and comprises thirteen coves outstretched within its scope (with three of them declared as Marine Protected Areas). Some of the activities offered are billiards, squash, tennis–all of which are available to members at a good price. However, one can still enjoy the place even as a guest.
			<h3> Mt. Pico De Loro </h3>
				A scenic mountain range in Maragondon, Cavite bordering the towns of Ternate and Nasugbu in the province of Batangas, Mt. Palay-Palay/Mataas na Gulod has been drawing visitors from all over the world. It is famous for the iconic Pico de Loro, named after the protruding rock that is akin to a parrot’s beak.
			<h3> Mt. Talamitam </h3>
				Talamitam is a mountain that had a more glorious past. It was named after the talamitam trees that used to grow on its slopes – a reminder of the time when Talamitam had lush vegetation and untarnished ecosystems. Today, it is a bald mountain, but efforts are underway to rehabilitate the peak with tree planting and other initiatives.
			<h3> Caleruega Church </h3>
				A chapel heavily featured in Filipino films and weddings, Caleruega’s Transfiguration Chapel does not really have much history. Moreover, the trip to the chapel can be quite taxing and can only be done if you have a private vehicle of your own. However, the majestic scenery and picturesque surroundings would definitely make up for the challenging trip. Perched on top of a garden-adorned hill, Caleruega offers a spectacular view of Batangas’s countryside with Mt. Batulao dominating the landscape. The relaxing scenery and beautiful landscape are two compelling reasons that make the Transfiguration Chapel one of the popular wedding venues and retreat destinations in the region.
			<h3> Bituin Cove </h3>
				The shore is lined with trees and the underwater scene is never lacking. There’s a manmade breakwater, the remnants of what used to be a helipad, and a rundown dock or diving platform. Apart from one or two small stalls, an open cottage, a rusty container van, and a simple white rest house, there’s nothing for lodging but the ground to pitch your tent. This is slowly becoming popular among those who like the outdoors and roughing it out by camping.
			<h3> Layon Bilog River </h3>
				Known for its freshwater streams and beautiful scenery, Layon Bilog River View is a new campsite and picnic area at the foot of Mt. Talamitam. To many, the area is still a secret attraction but over the years, it has seen a surge of tourists who are en route to Mt. Talamitam.
			<h3> Mt. Batulao </h3>
				If you are not much of a beach bum or just wish to take a break from the water then you might want to try mountain climbing instead. Mt Batulao is known to be an excellent start for neophytes in trekking and mountain climbing. It is safe to climb as well as the scope is inhabited by mostly friendly locals in the area. While the track to the peak may not be demanding, it takes about two to three hours of walking through paths before you can reach it and witness the sight of vast grasslands, striking formations and smell the fresh scent of the breeze atop the summit. With that said, Mt Batulao is definitely one of the places worth the visit to Batangas–especially if you wish to have a full and panoramic view of the province
			<h3> Tali Beach </h3>
				Known as one of the most visited and well-known attractions in Nasugbu, Batangas Tali Beach is understandably a summer favorite in Batangas. While it does not boast of white beaches typical in the Philippines, the emerald and azure-colored waters right before the khaki brown colored boulders are enough to take you in. Swimming and lounging by the beach are two inevitable activities but most people visit Tali Beach to try out cliff-jumping which is said to be a must if you wish to have the full experience. However, bear in mind that the beach is a private resort which means access to it is restricted to its residents, homeowners, and their guests. In this regard, knowing someone inside to allow you access is a must.
